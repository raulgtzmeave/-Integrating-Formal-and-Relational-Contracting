***Integrating Formal and Relational Contracting: Data Repository***

This repository contains the data used in the study titled “Integrating Formal and Relational Contracting: The Interplay Between Network Structure and Contract Design in Interlocal Collaboration Agreements.”

**Description of the Dataset**

The dataset includes information on a random sample of 300 bilateral interlocal agreements related to public safety in Iowa filed between 2007 and 2017.

**Variables**

	•	filing_number: Unique identifier for each agreement.
	•	service_type: The type of public safety service covered by the agreement (e.g., Criminal Investigation, Police Protection, Fire Response, Emergency Management, Jail and Corrections).
	•	mutual_partners: The number of mutual partners shared by the parties in the agreement.
	•	Principal-Agent: Indicates whether the agreement involves a principal-agent relationship (True/False).
	•	Integration mechanism: A categorical variable representing the level of integration mechanism used in the agreement.
	•	Shared governance: Indicates whether the agreement involves shared governance (True/False).
	•	Payment structure: Indicates whether the agreement outlines the method and terms under which financial transactions between the parties will occur (True/False).
	•	Frequency of Payment: Indicates whether the frequency of payments is specified in the agreement (True/False).
	•	Audit: Indicates the presence of an official document produced and validated by either (a) an independent external entity or (b) a designated department within the auditing party, following a set of explicitly defined standards (True/False).
	•	Evaluation: Indicates the presence of a clause stipulating that one party is granted the right to review or assess the performance of the other party throughout the duration of the contract (True/False).
	•	Report: Indicates the presence of stipulations mandating that one or more parties provide any form of report as specified (True/False).
	•	Mandatory discussion: Indicates whether the agreement mandates that the involved parties engage in discussions or consultations to evaluate the effectiveness of their contractual relationship (True/False).
	•	Access to records: Indicates the presence of a clause stipulating that one party is obligated to provide the other party with access to its relevant documentation and records (True/False).
	•	Insurance: Indicates the presence of a clause mandating that one or more parties involved in the agreement obtain some form of insurance (True/False).
	•	Liability Shift/Indemnification: Indicates whether an agreement explicitly indicates one party is liable for an occurrence or indemnifies the other party against a liability (True/False).
	•	Explicit Amendment: Indicates whether an agreement provides explicit amendment procedures (True/False).
	•	Alternative Dispute Resolution Clause: Indicates whether an agreement stipulates that the parties must submit to some form of mediation or arbitration (True/False).
	•	Severability Clause: Indicates whether an agreement includes any severability clauses that facilitate “modularity” in contract design (True/False).
	•	completeness: A score representing the overall completeness of the agreement, based on the presence of key contractual provisions (ranges from 0 to 12).
	•	filing_year: The year the agreement was filed.
	•	col_direction: The direction of collaboration (e.g., Horizontal, Vertical, Cross-sector).
	•	bonding_dum: A binary indicator of bonding social capital (1 if bonding social capital is present, 0 otherwise).
	•	tie_strength2: A measure of the strength of the tie (the count of previous collaboration) between the contracting parties.
	•	tie_strength_dum: A binary indicator of tie strength (1 if there is previous collaboration, 0 otherwise).
	•	service_contract: Indicates whether the agreement is a service contract (Yes/No).

**Usage**

The data can be used to analyze the interplay between formal and relational contracting approaches, focusing on how network structures influence contract design. Researchers can explore how bonding social capital, operationalized through the presence of mutual third-party connections, impacts the explicit detailing of contractual provisions.
